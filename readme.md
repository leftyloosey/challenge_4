# Challenge #4

## Hello

This was a tough one. I actually haven't quite finished the scoreboard because 
I am still figuring out localStorage, but, alas, I am out of time for now. I would have liked to clean up the code a bit, too, but I don't have the night off. 

It works for the most part, though. A fairly simple function that runs through an array of questions while a timer counts down. It was not fairly simple to write. I spent forever trying to make the indices of loops match up, etc. I like my little
hack of using the hidden string of spaces to mark the correct answer.

If I had more time I would make it pretty in addition to making it work.
